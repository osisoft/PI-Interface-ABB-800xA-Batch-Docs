# Introduction to [!include[interface](../includes/product-long.md)] [!include[interface](../includes/product-version.md)]

<!-- Add customized content between comments for the interace you're writing for -->

The [!include[interface](../includes/product-long.md)] [!include[version](../includes/product-version.md)] collects ABB system data from an Oracle-based 800xA backend to create Event Frames in PI Asset Framework.

OSIsoft offers two ABB 800xA Batch interfaces: one for the Production Data Log (an Oracle-based 800xA backend), and one for Production Response (SQL-based 800xA backend). [!include[interface](../includes/product-long.md)] [!include[version](../includes/product-version.md)] supports version 6.0.3.2 and 6.0.3.3 of the ABB 800xA Batch system.

You can define templates that help to specify which events trigger Event Frame creation, configure how the property or tag is named, and define the data to be stored.
